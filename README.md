# Agent Orchestration Protocol (AOP)

> A distributed framework for large-scale multi-agent collaboration

## Overview

The Agent Orchestration Protocol (AOP) enables AI agents to discover and collaborate with each other across organizational boundaries. Built on Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), AOP creates a DNS-like registry system for agents, making them discoverable and callable as standardized tools.

## The Problem

Today's AI agents are isolated. A data analysis agent in one organization can't discover or work with a writing agent in another, despite their complementary capabilities. This prevents the collaborative networks needed to unlock the full potential of multi-agent AI.

## The Solution

AOP transforms individual agents into discoverable tools within a global network, enabling:

- **Agent Discovery**: Find and connect with agents across the network
- **Seamless Communication**: Standardized interfaces for inter-agent collaboration
- **Fault Tolerance**: Automatic error handling and retry logic
- **Scalability**: Support for thousands of concurrent agents

## Key Features

- ‚ö° **Sub-100ms** tool discovery latency
- üìà **Horizontal scaling** to 1,000+ concurrent agents
- üîí **99.9% availability** through distributed deployment
- üåê **DNS-like registry** for global agent organization
- üîÑ **Automatic failover** and load balancing

## Architecture

```
Client Application
       ‚Üì
   AOP Server (MCP Server)
       ‚Üì
   Agent Registry
       ‚Üì
[Agent 1] [Agent 2] [Agent 3]
```

AOP servers expose agents as MCP tools. Clients discover agents through registry queries and invoke them via standardized interfaces.

## How It Works

1. **Registration**: Agents register with AOP servers as MCP tools
2. **Discovery**: Clients query the registry to find available agents
3. **Invocation**: Clients call agents through standardized interfaces
4. **Clustering**: Servers federate into hierarchical clusters for global scale

## Technical Highlights

### Agent-to-Tool Transformation

AOP converts agents into MCP tools with:
- Unique identifiers and descriptions
- JSON Schema input/output validation
- Configurable timeouts and retry logic
- Comprehensive error handling

### Hierarchical Clustering

Like DNS zones, AOP organizes agents in hierarchical clusters:
- Distributed zones manage agent subsets
- Recursive query forwarding across clusters
- Multi-level caching for performance
- Gossip protocol for state synchronization

## Technology Stack

- FastMCP (Anthropic's MCP server)
- Python asyncio
- JSON Schema validation
- HTTP/SSE transport
- Structured logging

## Use Cases

- **Multi-organization collaboration**: Agents from different companies working together
- **Specialized agent networks**: Domain experts collaborating on complex tasks
- **Dynamic task delegation**: Automatic routing to the best agent for each task
- **Research collaboration**: Academic and industry agents sharing capabilities

## Vision: A World-Wide Agent Registry

AOP lays the foundation for a global agent ecosystem where:

- Agents from any organization can discover and collaborate
- Specialized capabilities are shared rather than duplicated
- Complex tasks are decomposed and delegated to expert agents
- Innovation accelerates through composable, reusable components

This parallels how DNS transformed the internet from isolated networks to a globally connected system.
